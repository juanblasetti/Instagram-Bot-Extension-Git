Instagram-Bot-Chrome-Extention
Creating my own Google Chrome Extention for Instagram Flow Automation.

I am working on:

-Auto Likes
Auto likes are working now.

-Auto Follow
-Auto Unfollow
I am investigating on how to upload the extension to the official store. For now it can be loaded activating developer mode uploading a package.

There are some rules to go under the radar, not get banned, and some using advice. I am gonna be listing the most important ones:

-Make sure the email you registered the account is real and you have acces to it.

-Add at least 6 photos before starting running the automation.

-External Bio Links must lead to original and unique content.

-In case of multiple accounts:

-Create accounts that DO NOT have similar names, example: GithubHero1, GithubHero2, GithubHero3. (Instagram will assume these are the same)

-Images and captions for all your accounts must be at least slightly different.

-It's key to connect your instagram account to Facebook Business Pages.

-If you have less than 500 followers it is recommendable to only promote with the likes function. Not follow & unfollow.

-The unfollowing amount per day should not pass 700 hundred.

-Do not acces your instagram account from completely different locations.

-Upload profile picture and fill in profile bio.

-Add photos regularly.

-Do Not make duplicate instagram accounts. Instagram will ban all of them.

-The automation of your instagram account should look as human as possible. don't let the automations running 24 hours.

-Promote using comment is not recommendable. But if you are willing to take the risk, good luck.
